# Replicated Storage

## Introduction

Welcome to Replicated Storage! You'll be using this service a lot throughout your game-development journey.

## Description

Replicated Storage is a service that allows you to store data that can be accessed by both the client and the server. This is useful for storing data that you want to be accessible by both the client and the server, such as a player's inventory.

### Example

```lua ReplicatedStorage/ReplicatedStorage.lua
    local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
    local Players = game:GetService("Players")

    local LocalPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer

    local PlayerData = require(ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("PlayerData"))
    local PlayerInventory = PlayerData:GetInventory(LocalPlayer.Name)
    
    -- do something with the player's inventory
```

You see when a module is palced and required in ReplicatedStorage, it can be accessed by both the client and the server. While if you place a module in ServerScriptService, and require it from the client, it won't work and vice-versa.

## Retrieving the service

```lua ReplicatedStorage/ReplicatedStorage.lua
    local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
    -- or you can do
    local ReplicatedStorage = game.ReplicatedStorage
```
